  "aboutItems": [
    "I am a veteran full stack web developer and front end software engineer with 20+ years of development experience. I am most comfortable with JavaScript / TypeScript, React, HTML, and CSS in various back-end environments, including Next.js, Node.js, PHP, Java, and Ruby on Rails.",
    "I recently spent a year contracting with a team at Etsy to facilitate server-side rendering of React component islands, able to communicate through a shared Redux store. This helped product engineers to provide enhanced user experiences for Etsy customers, while still maintaining fast page load times, through on-demand hydration of static content with interactive features.",
    "In the time since Etsy, I have focused mostly on my own business, WebEquate. I have been rebuilding websites previously built with PHP and MySQL, instead using Next.js, React, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Vercel, to modernize my development workflow, streamline site updates, and improve site performance.",
    "Now I am seeking a new opportunity as a Full Stack Web Developer or Front End Software Engineer, with a preference for fully remote roles.",
    "I also enjoy travel, hiking, photography, electronic music, generative AI, and foreign languages."
